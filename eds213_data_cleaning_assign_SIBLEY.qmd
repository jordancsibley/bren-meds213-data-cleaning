## Overview

We cleaned the Snow_cover column during class. Inspiring yourself from the steps we followed, do the following in a quarto document:

1.  Clean the Water_cover column to transform it into the correct data type and respect expectations for a percentage

2.  Clean the Land_cover column to transform it into the correct data type and respect expectations for a percentage

3.  Use the relationship between the three cover columns (Snow, Water, Land) to infer missing values where possible and recompute the Total_cover column as needed

Add comments to your quarto document about your decisions and assumptions, this will be a large part of the grading. 

#### The expectations are:
- The Quarto document eds213_data_cleaning_assign_YOURNAME.qmd should run if your repo is cloned locally (5 pts; Reproducibility)
- The code should output a csv file named all_cover_fixed_YOURNAME.csv in the data/processed folder (5 pts; Code)
- Comment your code well (10 pts; Documentation)
- Your quarto document should provide all the necessary explanations about your decisions and discuss any assumptions you made (donâ€™t forget to look at the metadata!) (30 pts; Documentation)
- The code should perform the 3 data cleaning steps describe above to enable ingestion into a database (50 pts; Technical concepts)


## Data 

This data has been pre processed to correct the `Snow_cover` column 

```{r}
# Load packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

Snow_cover <- read.csv(here("data", "processed", "snow_cover.csv"))
```
